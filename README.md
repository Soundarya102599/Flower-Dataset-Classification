# Flower-Dataset-Classification
This project isbased ondesigninga Naïve Byes Model to classify a flower dataset. Naïve Bayes classifier are a family of simple “probability classifier”. NB is based on applying Bayes theorem with strong independence assumption between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network modules but coupled with kernel density estimation. Naïve Bayes classifier are highly scalable, requiring number of parameters linear in the number of variables in a learning problem. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.The test-set accuracy to be 0.93.So,the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification model is doing a very good job in predicting the class labels.
